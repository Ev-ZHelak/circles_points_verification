# Circle and Point

This program is a simple graphical example demonstrating the visual verification of a point's belonging to a circle.

## Usage

1. Make sure you have the necessary libraries installed (matplotlib).
2. Run the program, preferably in an environment with graphics support.
3. The program will generate random circles and points and display their graphical representation.
4. You will see the circle, its center, the test point, and the result of the test in the title.

   Circle formula: `(x−h)^2 + (y−k)^2 = r^2`

5. If the point belongs to the circle, the program will pause and wait for you to press Enter.

## Notes

- The choice of backend for matplotlib may be required depending on your operating system and environment.
